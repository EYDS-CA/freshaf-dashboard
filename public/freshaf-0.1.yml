questions:
- id: app-runs-locally
  summary: App runs end-to-end locally
  points:
    velocity: 5
  description: | 
    "End-to-end" here means the frontend, backend, and database can be
    easily spun up so anyone can test the app locally. This can be achieved quite
    easily using docker-compose.
  benefits:
    - Increases iteration speed. Pushing code to a dev environment in order to test it is slow and can disrupt other developers.
    - Improves onboarding. It's much easier to learn a code base if you can run it locally.

- id: pr-linting
  summary: Automatic linting
  points:
    velocity: 2
  description: | 
    Something automatically enforces linting rules. 
    Possibly a linting check on PRs. 
    Possibly a pre-commit hook so you can't commit unlinted code.
  benefits:
    - Tidier code is easier to read.
    - Forces you to pick a codestyle, which reduces arguments.
